					<p>This book, it may be as well to remind some readers, is not, as it is still often described, one of Defoe’s novels, but the genuine experiences of an English officer in Spain during the Succession War. <a href="../text/translators-preface.xhtml#note-1" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>The humor of this, and indeed of the greater part of the Preface, can hardly be relished without a knowledge of the books of the day, but especially Lope de Vega’s, which in their original editions appeared generally with an imposing display of complimentary sonnets and verses, as well as of other adjuncts of the sort Cervantes laughs at. Lope’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Isidro</i> (1599) had ten pieces of complimentary verse prefixed to it, and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hermosura de Angelica</i> (1602) had seven. Hartzenbusch remarks that Aristotle and Plato are the first authors quoted by Lope in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Peregrino en su Patrin</i> (1604).</p>
					<p>Who the two or three obliging friends may have been is not easy to say. Young Quevedo, who had just then taken his place in the front rank of the poets of the day, was, no doubt, one; Espinel may have been another; and Jauregui might have been the third. Cervantes had not many friends among the poets of the day. His friendships lay rather among those of the generation that was dying out when <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Don Quixote</i> appeared. <a href="../text/preface-1.xhtml#note-4" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>The national dish, the <i xml:lang="es">olla</i>, of which the <i xml:lang="es">puchero</i> of Central and Northern Spain is a poor relation, is a stew with beef, bacon, sausage, chickpeas, and cabbage for its prime constituents, and for ingredients any other meat or vegetable that may be available. There is nothing exceptional in Don Quixote’s <i xml:lang="es">olla</i> being more a beef than a mutton one, for mutton is scarce in Spain except in the mountain districts. <i xml:lang="es">Salpicon</i> (salad) is meat minced with red peppers, onions, oil, and vinegar, and is in fact a sort of meat salad. <i xml:lang="es">Duelos y quebrantos</i>, the title of the Don’s Saturday dish, would be a puzzle even to the majority of Spanish readers were it not for Pellicer’s explanation. In the cattle-feeding districts of Spain, the carcasses of animals that came to an untimely end were converted into salt meat, and the parts unfit for that purpose were sold cheap under the name of <i xml:lang="es">duelos y quebrantos</i>⁠—“sorrows and losses” (literally “breakings”) and were held to be sufficiently unlike meat to be eaten on days when flesh was forbidden, among which in Castile Saturday was included in commemoration of the battle of Navas de Tolosa. Any rendering of such a phrase must necessarily be unsatisfactory, and in adopting “scraps” I have, as in the other cases, merely gone on the principle of choosing the least of evils. <a href="../text/chapter-1-1.xhtml#note-14" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>Antonio’s ballad is in imitation of a species of popular poetry that occupies nearly as large a space as the romantic and historical ballads in the old <i xml:lang="es">romanceros</i>. These gay, naive, simple lays of peasant life and love are as thoroughly national and peculiar to Spain as the historical ballads themselves, and in every way present a striking contrast to the artificial pastoral sonnets and canciones of Italian importation. The imitation of this kind of poetry was a favorite pastime with the poets of the Spanish Augustan age, and strange to say the poet who showed the lightest touch and brightest fancy in these compositions, and caught most happily the simplicity and freshness of the originals, was Gongora, whose name is generally associated with poetry the exact opposite of this in every particular. Cervantes apparently valued himself more upon his sonnets and artificial verses; a preference regretted, I imagine, by most of his readers. This ballad has been hardly treated by the translators. The language and measures used by Shelton and Jervas are about as well adapted to represent a Spanish popular lyric as a dray-horse to draw a pony-chaise. The measure of the original is the ordinary ballad measure, an eight-syllable trochaic, with the assonant rhyme in the second and fourth lines.

					<p>The passage⁠—beginning at “That night they reached the very heart,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and ending with “returned thanks for the kindness shown him by Don Quixote”⁠—does not appear in the first edition, in which there is no allusion to the loss of the ass until the middle of <a href="../text/chapter-1-25.xhtml">Chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXV</span></a>, where, without any explanation of how it happened, Cervantes speaks of Dapple as having been lost.

In the third edition of 1608 some of these inconsistencies were removed, and in the Second Part Cervantes refers to the matter, and charges the printer with the blunder. What he originally intended, no doubt, was to supplement the burlesque of the penance of Amadis by a burlesque of Brunello’s theft of Sacripante’s horse and Marfisa’s sword at the siege of Albracca, as described by Boiardo and Ariosto; and it was very possibly an after-thought written on a loose leaf and so mislaid or lost <i xml:lang="la">in transitu</i>.

					<p>The fertile wit was, of course, Lope de Vega, at whom, in particular, this criticism is aimed; and Cervantes shows great adroitness in the mode in which he has conducted his attack.

This chapter has a peculiar interest, not only as showing the views of Cervantes, but as furnishing an explanation of the bitter feeling with which he was unquestionably regarded by Lope and Lope’s school; a feeling that found expression a few years later in the attack made upon him by Avellaneda. Cervantes himself shortly afterwards in his comedies violated nearly all the principles he lays down here, and in the second act of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Rufian Dichoso</i> solemnly reads his recantation.

					<p>Count Fernán González of Castile, the hero of many ballads, flourished in the tenth century; for Gonzalo Fernandez, or Hernandez, and Diego García de Paredes see notes to chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXII</span>: García Perez de Vargas is the hero of more than one ballad, but from the mention of Jerez it may be that Cervantes meant Diego Perez de Vargas, who, at the siege of Jerez, performed the feat that got him the name of the Pounder. (See chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>.) Garcilaso is not the poet but an ancestor of his, known as “el del Ave Maria,” from having slain at the battle of the Salado a Moor who appeared with a label bearing the words “Ave Maria” tied to his horse’s tail; an exploit generally said to have been performed at Granada. Don Manuel Ponce de León was a knight of the time of Ferdinand and Isabella, who figures in the ballads of the Siege of Granada; for him see note to chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVII</span> Part <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. <a href="../text/chapter-1-49.xhtml#note-391" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>

					<p>Whether or not this is to he held an indication of some grudge on the part of Cervantes against the authorties of the town, it is, at any rate, conclusive that Don Quixote’s village, “the name of which he did not care to call to mind,” was Argamasilla. “Monicongo” may he translated “mannikin”; “Paniaguado” is a sort of parasite hanging about the house of a patron for such scraps as he can pick up; “Burlador” means a joker, and “Cachidiablo” a hobgoblin. Except, perhaps, in the sonnet on Sancho Panza, there is not much drollery or humor in these verses, but it would not be fair to criticise them severely, as they are obviously nothing more than a mere outburst reckless nonsense to finish off with; a sort of flourish or <i xml:lang="es">rubrica</i> like that commonly appended to a Spanish signature. <a href="../text/chapter-1-52.xhtml#note-410" epub:type="se:referrer">↩</a></p>
